        Whining, groaning the curved staircase cries, Each step’s pressure
        release whispers that rise. Somber, black corridors embrace the hushed
        chatter, Howling winds deafen with raindrops that clatter.

        Shadowy figures flow into the room, Tiny hands clasping, meager voice
        cloaked in doom. Inquisitive, curious, cautionary and knowing, Dark
        tales unwoven, eyes glistening and glowing.

        Moonlight drapes the bed where two figures sit down, Large figure is
        calm, present, curled lips in a frown. His shadow pulls back, begins
        gliding away, Followed by urgent pleas and bargains to stay.

        Hats, cloaks and costumes bring fables to life, Lairs, nests and dens
        are home to the rife. Voice swells in crescendo over the hollow storm
        sounds, Bouncing and shrieking in energy that bounds.

        This entity is unknown, unrelenting and feared, The darkness is haunted
        with rituals revered. Biting, and chewing, drinking til’ death, It’s
        victims disintegrate with a painful last breath.

        Hung in the closet, abandoned skeletons will sway, Flesh and meat
        stripped, no sign of decay. Click-clack, rattle goes the bones in the
        breeze, Sinister windchimes, drooping in ominous trees.

        This menacing character has a title and names, “It’s the click-clack
        rattle bag!” the little figure exclaims. “He’s everywhere, and nowhere,
        he’s alive, and in your dreams, He feeds off the fear embedded in your
        screams.”

        For years as the shadow tucked in the corners of the bed, I never meant
        to harm, haunt or leave impending dread. I do not bite, eat, drink or
        chew. I simply protect, But the little figure has only returned lies and
        neglect. And yet, I will stay and watch as he shivers, Grasping at the
        covers with small hands that quiver. In the corners I lurk as the night
        sky descends, The “click-clack rattle bag,” a lonely shadow with no
        friends.
