            Whining, groaning the curved staircase cries,<br />
            Each step’s pressure release whispers that rise.<br />
            Somber, black corridors embrace the hushed chatter,<br />
            Howling winds deafen with raindrops that clatter.

            Shadowy figures flow into the room, <br />
            Tiny hands clasping, meager voice cloaked in doom. <br />
            Inquisitive, curious, cautionary and knowing,<br />
            Dark tales unwoven, eyes glistening and glowing.

            Moonlight drapes the bed where two figures sit down,<br />
            Large figure is calm, present, curled lips in a frown. <br />
            His shadow pulls back, begins gliding away,<br />
            Followed by urgent pleas and bargains to stay.

            Hats, cloaks and costumes bring fables to life,<br />
            Lairs, nests and dens are home to the rife. <br />
            Voice swells in crescendo over the hollow storm sounds,<br />
            Bouncing and shrieking in energy that bounds.

            This entity is unknown, unrelenting and feared, <br />
            The darkness is haunted with rituals revered.<br />
            Biting, and chewing, drinking til’ death,<br />
            It’s victims disintegrate with a painful last breath.

            Hung in the closet, abandoned skeletons will sway,<br />
            Flesh and meat stripped, no sign of decay.<br />
            Click-clack, rattle goes the bones in the breeze, <br />
            Sinister windchimes, drooping in ominous trees.

            This menacing character has a title and names,<br />
            “It’s the click-clack rattle bag!” the little figure exclaims.<br />
            “He’s everywhere, and nowhere, he’s alive, and in your dreams,<br />
            He feeds off the fear embedded in your screams.”

            For years as the shadow tucked in the corners of the bed, <br />
            I never meant to harm, haunt or leave impending dread.<br />
            I do not bite, eat, drink or chew. I simply protect,<br />
            But the little figure has only returned lies and neglect. <br />
            And yet, I will stay and watch as he shivers,<br />
            Grasping at the covers with small hands that quiver.<br />
            In the corners I lurk as the night sky descends, <br />
            The “click-clack rattle bag,” a lonely shadow with no friends.
