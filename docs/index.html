          Whining, groaning the curved staircase cries,<br />
          Each step’s pressure release whispers that rise.<br />
          Somber, black corridors embrace the hushed chatter,<br />
          Howling winds deafen with raindrops that clatter.

          Shadowy figures flow into the room, <br />
          Tiny hands clasping, meager voice cloaked in doom. <br />
          Inquisitive, curious, cautionary and knowing,<br />
          Dark tales unwoven, eyes glistening and glowing.

          Moonlight drapes the bed where two figures sit down,<br />
          Large figure is calm, present, curled lips in a frown. <br />
          His shadow pulls back, begins gliding away,<br />
          Followed by urgent pleas and bargains to stay.

          Hats, cloaks and costumes bring fables to life,<br />
          Lairs, nests and dens are home to the rife. <br />
          Voice swells in crescendo over the hollow storm sounds,<br />
          Bouncing and shrieking in energy that bounds.

          This entity is unknown, unrelenting and feared, <br />
          The darkness is haunted with rituals revered.<br />
          Biting, and chewing, drinking til’ death,<br />
          It’s victims disintegrate with a painful last breath.

          Hung in the closet, abandoned skeletons will sway,<br />
          Flesh and meat stripped, no sign of decay.<br />
          Click-clack, rattle goes the bones in the breeze, <br />
          Sinister windchimes, drooping in ominous trees.

          This menacing character has a title and names,<br />
          “It’s the click-clack rattle bag!” the little figure exclaims.<br />
          “He’s everywhere, and nowhere, he’s alive, and in your dreams,<br />
          He feeds off the fear embedded in your screams.”

          For years as the shadow tucked in the corners of the bed, <br />
          I never meant to harm, haunt or leave impending dread.<br />
          I do not bite, eat, drink or chew. I simply protect,<br />
          But the little figure has only returned lies and neglect. <br />
          And yet, I will stay and watch as he shivers,<br />
          Grasping at the covers with small hands that quiver.<br />
          In the corners I lurk as the night sky descends, <br />
          The “click-clack rattle bag,” a lonely shadow with no friends.
